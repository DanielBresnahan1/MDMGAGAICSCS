        This test will boot a selenium driver, access the application at the specified url, and ensure that the necessary aspects of the cookies are functional.
        It will do this by going through the entire random forest section, returning to the beginning, and running thorugh the random forest section a second time.
        It will check that the second time it is only presented with five images, and that the ten specified images from before also appear.
    @param url: The url which the test will attempt to reach. Defaults to a local url.
